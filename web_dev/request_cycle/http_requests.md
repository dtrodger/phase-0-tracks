Some of the most common HTTP errors I found were 500's 400's and 200s. I think 500's informa the user that w=there was a problem running the backend code on the web server. 400 request tell the user that that page they are looking for does not exist. HTTP 200 codes mean the page was successfully loaded.

GET requests get infromation from the server hile post request try to psot new informstion to persist within the server.
