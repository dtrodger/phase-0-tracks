I plan on attempting to build .js with jQuery that will allow content 'slide down' and 'slide up' when a button is clicked, similar to faqs with slide u and slide down answers. The best place to start is to research stackoverflow to people trying to build similar scripts.

jQuery tutorials will help as well as codeschool.coms free iQuery course

I dont write more than a fwe lines of code brefoer stopping to test

Breaks are always important when developing. 

Effective jquery study tools we, Hands down, online tutorials via Youtube or school.
