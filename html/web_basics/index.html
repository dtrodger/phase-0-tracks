			<h2>Basic HTML tags used below</h2>
			<p>This is a paragraph tag. A paragraph. A paragraph tag is used to seperate paragraphs of content. My 4th grade english teach would be upset if I marked this up as a paragraph and did not put at least three sentances in it, so this final sentance is extraneous information. Mr. Scholer was the bomb.</p>

			<h4>If you wrap a word with the <strong>strong</strong> tags, the word appears bold. The strong tags also provide semantic meaning by pointing out that certain words in a section are more important than others.</h4>
			<br>
			<h4>If you wrap a word with the <em>em</em> tags, the word appears bold. THe em tag is similar to the strong tag because it provides semantic meaning that the content between the tags is important. The styling effect of both strong and em can be change or removed with css, but screenreading software would still interpret the word as important.</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>If you wrap content in ul tags,</li>
				<li>then break the content up and divide it between li tags within the ul tags,</li>
				<li>the content will be rendered as an unordered list.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>If you wrap content in ol tags,</li>
				<li>then break up the content and divide it between li tags within the ol tags,</li>
				<li>the content will be rendered as an ordered list like this one!</li>
			</ol>

			<p>An a tag, or ancher tag, allows the html page to render a link like <a href="https://www.google.com">this</a>.</p>

			<img src="screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" style='height:150px;width:150px;'/>
			<h4>The image above was made possible by an img tag. Img tags render images from relative paths given to their src attribute.</h4>
